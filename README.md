# Yousaybot
bot for playing you say run and other stuff  
sounded funnier in my head  
no, im not a weeb (i think)  

### what can the bot do
![](https://github.com/laptopoutofbattery/Yousaybot/blob/main/HelpScreenshot.png?raw=true)  
Bot can:
- Join voice channels on command .join
- Leave voice channels on command .leave
- Say hi on command .hi
- Play music (yousayrun or whtever file) on command .play
- Stops music on command .stop
- Pause music on command .pause
- Resumes music on command .resume
- Gives custom role (created when bot joins server) on command .yousayrun
- Removes custom yousayrun role on command .yousayrun remove
- Gives info on commands and general info with .help and .help [command]  

**With yousayrun role:**  
  When user types "you", "say" or "run", bot says "Yousayrun?" and plays yousayrun if in vc or joins users vc and plays  
  When a message is sent, has a (kinda) random chance to join users vc and play yousayrun or play yousayrun if already in a vc

### Thoughts and takeaways
Coming into this I really just wanted to try making a discord bot.  
The bot is really simple (and useless) and much of the code is copied and adapted, but it was fun to make  

Future me's problems:
- make a more useful bot
- actually host the bot
- implement youtube playing feature
- implement looping of music
- write better english
- improve on randomness
  
Most of the process was searching up how to do things and putting them into my code  
Also these tutorials are really nice https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-7Dfw57ZZVRB4N7VWPjmT0Q-2FIMNBMP
